# FireRouter

This is sort of a gimmick local reverse proxy for use with LLMs. I'll add stupid features as I want them. Currently it just lets you randomize openrouter models.

I won't add any form of auth, Lord have mercy on my soul because Billy Gilly certainly wouldn't.

Everything here could probably be done with SillyTavern extensions but fuck extending SillyTavern.

## Configuration

See the config.yaml. I will try to find the strength of will to actually document this later.
